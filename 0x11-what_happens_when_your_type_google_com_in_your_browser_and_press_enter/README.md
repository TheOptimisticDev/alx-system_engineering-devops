Background Context
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.

A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.

Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.

This question is a classic and still widely used interview question for many types of software engineering position. It is used to assess a candidate’s general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. One important guideline to begin answering this question is that you should ask your interviewer whether they would like you to focus in on one specific area of the workflow. For a front-end position they may want you to talk at length about how the DOM is rendering. For an SRE position they may want you to go into the load balancing mechanism. 

Requirements, your post must cover:

DNS request
TCP/IP
Firewall
HTTPS/SSL
Load-balancer
Web server
Application server
Database
